# magic_cube

The International Baccalaureate requires students to undertake an Exploration project in Mathematics. I chose to devise and prove mathematically a mapping function that creates an odd-ordered magic cube (3D magic square) from 3D cell coordinates. The mathematical proof was done in Google Docs but I performed large-scale verifications using Python. The program cube.py was initially used for verification but I commented out the part of the program for verification so that it only prints the layers of the magic cube itself.
